# NdiMedia

Unreal Engine 4 Media Framework plug-in for NewTek's Network Device Interface (NDI).

![Logo](Docs/logo.png)


## About

NDIâ„¢ (Network Device Interface) is a standard created by NewTek to make it easy
to develop video-related products that share video on a local Ethernet network
(video over IP). This plug-in makes NDI media input streams available in Unreal
Engine 4.

Make sure to pull the *Tag* that matches your Unreal Engine version. If you sync
to *Master* the code may not compile, because it may depend on Engine changes
that are not yet available in the UE4 Master branch.


## Supported Platforms

This plug-in was last built against **Unreal Engine 4.18** and tested on the
following platforms:

- ~~iOS~~
- ~~Linux~~
- ~~macOS~~
- Windows


## Prerequisites

All required header files and libraries for supported platforms are included in
this plug-in. If you'd like to make modifications to this plug-in, download the
latest version of the NDI SDK from the Newtek web site for updated documentation
and files.


## Dependencies

This plug-in requires Visual Studio and either a C++ code project or the full
Unreal Engine 4 source code from GitHub. If you are new to programming in UE4,
please see the official [Programming Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/index.html)! 


## Usage
